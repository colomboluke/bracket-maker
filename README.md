# Bracket Maker

Bracket Maker is a React-based web app that lets users create and vote on March Madness-style brackets for any category: movies, songs, sports teams, and more. Inspired by a game I play with friends on paper, this version brings the fun online, adding some statistics at the end, and the ability to export brackets and share them with friends. No logins of any kind required.
