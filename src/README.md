# Bracket Maker

Bracket Maker is a React-based web app that lets users create and vote on March Madness-style brackets for any category: movies, songs, sports teams, and more. Inspired by a game I play with friends on paper, this version brings the fun online and adds some statistical features. Users can also create a bracket template and share it with friends. No logins required.
