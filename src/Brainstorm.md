TODO:
- For the bracket, I think I'm going to make it capped at 64 teams, and always have 6 rounds (some of which might not be visible)
- figure out how to space each round of the bracketâ€”each round should have a fixed height, and the matchups need to be sized/spaced according to how many there are
- Have the bracket have a re-seed option: after each round, the top seed will play the lowest, etc. By default this will be off
-
