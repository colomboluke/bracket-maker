            <h1>Bracket Maker Help</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A Voting Bracket is my name for a game where one or multiple people simulate a March
                Madness style tournament for things other than sports teams. I've seen brackets for
                favorite rap songs, fast food places, movies, basically anything you can think of.
                They're usually single-elimination tournament style, so the highest seed plays the
                lowest seed, and the winners advance. At the end,
                the winner can be crowned 'The Group's Favorite Movie', for example. However, most
                of the fun is seeing what makes it far and getting unconventional matchups that you
                might not have thought of yourself. Don't worry too much about the ultimate
                winner—journey before destination, as some would say.</p>
            <h2>Seeding</h2>
            <p>Seeding can be done a number of ways. I
                recommend random, or using some external metric that you can easily look up—for
                example, number of streams on Spotify, a random magazine's ranking, etc.</p>
